                                #The four scrum ceremonies and their outputs
Sprint Planning: This is where the team (Tech Lead, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, Design Lead, UX Researcher, Content Strategist) meets and decides what they need to complete in the coming sprint.The output for the sprint planning is the definition of work required to construct a single, integrated and potentially shippable increment that meets the common definition of done.

Daily Scrum: This is a standup meeting, or a very short – 15-minute mini-meeting – for the team to make sure they’re all on the same page.The output of the Daily Scrum consists of a daily plan and (potentially) adjustments to the Sprint Backlog that are needed to reach the Sprint Goal.

Sprint Review: This is another scrum meeting, but one in which the team demos what they shipped in the sprint.The primary output of the sprint review is an updated product backlog. The Scrum Team should update the Product Backlog to reflect stakeholder feedback.

Sprint Retrospective: This is when the team reviews their work, identifying what they did well and what didn’t go as planned, so they can make the next sprint better. The output of Sprint Retrospective are new backlog items for the next sprint.
